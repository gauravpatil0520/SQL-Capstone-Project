# SQL-Capstone-Project

**Introduction to Case**
Ginny is a big fan of Japanese food, so she decided to start a restaurant at the beginning of 2021 that sells his three favorite
foods: sushi, curry, and ramen.
 Ginny's Diner needs your help to stay afloat – the restaurant has collected some fundamental data from their few months of
operation but has no idea how to use it to help them operate the business.

**Problem Statement**

Ginny wants to use the data to answer a few simple questions about his customers, especially about their:
● visiting patterns,
● how much money they’ve spent, and
● which menu items are their favorite.
This deeper connection with her customers will help her deliver a better and more personalized experience for her loyal
customers.
She plans on using these insights to help him decide whether she should expand the existing customer loyalty program.
Additionally, she needs help to generate some essential datasets so her team can quickly inspect the data without needing to
use SQL

**Problem Statement (contd.)**

The data set contains the following three tables, which you may refer to in the relationship diagram below to understand the
connection:
● sales
● members
● menu

Problem Statement - 1
1) What is the total amount each customer spent at the restaurant?
   
   SELECT
s.customer_id,
SUM(price) AS total_sales
FROM
dbo.sales AS s
JOIN dbo.menu AS m
ON s.product_id = m.product_id
GROUP BY customer_id

2)How many days has each customer visited the restaurant?

SELECT
customer_id,
 COUNT(DISTINCT(order_date)) AS visit_count
FROM
dbo.sales
GROUP BY customer_id;

3) What was the first item from the menu purchased by each customer?

   WITH ordered_sales_cte AS
(
 SELECT customer_id, order_date, product_name,
 DENSE_RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY s.customer_id
 ORDER BY s.order_date) AS rank
 FROM dbo.sales AS s
 JOIN dbo.menu AS m
 ON s.product_id = m.product_id
)
SELECT customer_id, product_name
FROM ordered_sales_cte
WHERE rank = 1
GROUP BY customer_id, product_name;

4) What is the most purchased item on the menu and how many times was it purchased by all customers?
   
   SELECT (COUNT(s.product_id)) AS most_purchased, product_name
FROM dbo.sales AS s
JOIN dbo.menu AS m
 ON s.product_id = m.product_id
GROUP BY s.product_id, product_name
ORDER BY most_purchased DESC
LIMIT 1

5) Which item was the most popular one for each customer?

   WITH fav_item_cte AS
(
 SELECT s.customer_id, m.product_name,
 COUNT(m.product_id) AS order_count,
 DENSE_RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY s.customer_id
 ORDER BY COUNT(m.product_id) DESC) AS rank
FROM dbo.menu AS m
JOIN dbo.sales AS s
 ON m.product_id = s.product_id
GROUP BY s.customer_id, m.product_name
)
SELECT customer_id, product_name, order_count
FROM fav_item_cte
WHERE rank = 1;

6) Which item was purchased first by the customer after they became a member?

   WITH member_sales_cte AS
(
 SELECT s.customer_id, m.join_date, s.order_date, s.product_id,
 DENSE_RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY s.customer_id
 ORDER BY s.order_date) AS rank
 FROM dbo.sales AS s
 JOIN dbo.members AS m
 ON s.customer_id = m.customer_id
 WHERE s.order_date = m.join_date
)
SELECT s.customer_id, s.order_date, m2.product_name
FROM member_sales_cte AS s
JOIN dbo.menu AS m2
 ON s.product_id = m2.product_id

7) Which item was purchased right before the customer became a member?

   WITH prior_member_purchased_cte AS
(
 SELECT s.customer_id, m.join_date, s.order_date, s.product_id,
 DENSE_RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY s.customer_id
 ORDER BY s.order_date DESC) AS rank
 FROM dbo.sales AS s
 JOIN dbo.members AS m
 ON s.customer_id = m.customer_id
 WHERE s.order_date < m.join_date
)
SELECT s.customer_id, s.order_date, m2.product_name
FROM prior_member_purchased_cte AS s
JOIN dbo.menu AS m2
 ON s.product_id = m2.product_id
WHERE rank = 1;

8) What is the total number of items and amount spent for each member before they became a member?

   SELECT
 s.customer_id,
 COUNT(DISTINCT s.product_id) AS unique_menu_item,
 SUM(mm.price) AS total_sales
 FROM
 dbo.sales AS s
 JOIN
 dbo.members AS m
 ON s.customer_id = m.customer_id
 JOIN
 dbo.menu AS mm
 ON s.product_id = mm.product_id
 WHERE s.order_date < m.join_date
 GROUP BY s.customer_id;

9) If each customers’ $1 spent equates to 10 points and sushi has a 2x points multiplier — how many points would each customer
   have?

 WITH price_points AS
 (
 SELECT *,
 CASE
 WHEN product_id = 1 THEN price * 20
 ELSE price * 10
 END AS points
 FROM
 dbo.menu
 )

 SELECT
 s.customer_id,
 SUM(p.points) AS total_points
 FROM
 price_points AS p
 JOIN
 dbo.sales AS s
 ON p.product_id = s.product_id
 GROUP BY
 s.customer_id
 ORDER BY
 customer_id

10) In the first week after a customer joins the program, (including their join date) they earn 2x points on all items; not just sushi —
    how many points do customer A and B have at the end of Jan21?

  WITH dates_cte AS
(
SELECT *,
 join_date + INTERVAL'6 day' AS valid_date,
 DATE('2021-01-31') AS last_date
 FROM
 dbo.members AS m
 ),
 points_cte AS (
 SELECT d.customer_id, s.order_date, d.join_date,
 d.valid_date, d.last_date, m.product_name, m.price,
 SUM(CASE
 WHEN m.product_name = 'sushi' THEN 2 * 10 * m.price
 WHEN s.order_date BETWEEN d.join_date AND d.valid_date THEN 2 * 10 * m.price
 ELSE 10 * m.price
 END) AS points
